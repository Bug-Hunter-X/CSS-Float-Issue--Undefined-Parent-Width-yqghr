The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This code snippet intends to create two divs side-by-side, each occupying 50% of the width of their parent container. However, in some browsers, this may not work as expected if the parent container doesn't have a defined width.  The floats will work, but the total width may exceed 100%, leading to overflow or unexpected layout.
