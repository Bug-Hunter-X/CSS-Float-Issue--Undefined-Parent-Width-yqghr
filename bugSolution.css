Here's how to fix the layout using flexbox:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  box-sizing: border-box; /* fix potential padding/border issues */
}

.parent {
  display: flex;
}
```

Adding `display: flex` to the parent container will distribute its children's width according to the specified width of each child, making the layout predictable and consistent across browsers.  The `box-sizing: border-box` property ensures that padding and border are included within the 50% width calculation.
